About
======
I am a PhD candidate in the Human-Centred Computing Department at Monash University, Australia and a [Monash Data Futures Institute](https://www.monash.edu/data-futures-institute/about-us/people/monash-data-futures-institute-phd-students) scholarship recipient. My research explores the interplay between data production and power in cities, focusing on the role of people in civic data governance and the potential of participatory approaches to advance a people-centred agenda. I approach data and technology with a critical, social justice-oriented lens and I am a proponent of furthering systemic thinking in Human -Centred Computing. 

I am also working as a research assistant with the Faculty of Business on co-designing a governance structure for an Indigenous-led coalition in agriculture. Additionally, I teach, most prominently and passionately, courses on data in society and research methods in information technology.

My academic journey has been richly interdisciplinary. I began with a BE in Civil Engineering from Notre Dame University in Lebanon, where I was born and raised. I then pursued a research-based [MSc in Bioresource Engineering](https://www.mcgill.ca/bioeng/faculty-and-staff/academic-staff/jan-adamowski/research-team) at McGill University, Canada. During this time, I had the privilege of a lifetime working with the Mayan Kaqchikel community in Tz’öloj Ya’, Guatemala, implementing [participatory modelling approaches](https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/25/1283/2021/hess-25-1283-2021.html).
