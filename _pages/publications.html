        <h4>
          ‘Unsolvable within existing regimes’: Using a systems thinking approach to co-design for data governance in cities
          <span> We propose a participatory approach, based on systems thinking and inspired by social justice-oriented design, to serve as a scoping tool for prototyping HCI solutions and proposals.</span>

This work addresses these questions by presenting a characterisation and typology of people-centred data governance models in cities, developed through a systematic scoping review of the literature.</span>

         Barriers and enablers to embedding people-centred data governance interventions in cities 
          <span>Can people-centred interventions in data governance be embedded and anchored in cities? What enables these initiatives to move beyond experimentation? I am collaborating with the Interdisciplinary Internet Institute (IN3) in Barcelona on a case study to explore these questions.</span>
